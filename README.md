# Google-Form---Case-tracking-system
This app tracks cases when you submit into a form and notifies everyone interested in the case when the case status changes

You can use it as a rudimentary support or ticketing tool to track requests and notify participants via calendar invites and email updates.

You could also use it for Product Lifecycle Management to collaborate between product and client facing teams. For example if you are a client facing team that is tracking the status of various features on a product you can add yourself to the list of pending features so you will be notified when the status of the feature changes such as release date, availability, priority, owner etc.
